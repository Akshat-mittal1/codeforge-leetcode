## üìÑ Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`, return the **length of the longest subsequence** of `s` such that the **binary value** of the subsequence is less than or equal to `k`.

---

## üß† Approach

- Traverse the string from **right to left** (LSB to MSB).
- Always include `'0'` since it does not increase the value but increases the length.
- For `'1'`, include only if its value `2^power` keeps the total value ‚â§ `k`.
- Maintain `val` for current binary value and `power` for current bit index.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

---

## ‚úÖ Example

```python
Input:
s = "1001010"
k = 5

Subsequence: "00010"
Binary value = 2 ‚â§ 5
Length = 5

Output: 5
```
