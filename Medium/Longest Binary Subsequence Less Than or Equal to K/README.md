## üß† Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`, return the **length of the longest subsequence** of `s` such that the **binary value** of the subsequence is less than or equal to `k`.

---

## üîç Approach

- Traverse the string from **right to left** (LSB to MSB).
- Always include `'0'` since it does not increase the value but increases the length.
- For `'1'`, include only if its value `2^power` keeps total value ‚â§ `k`.
- Maintain `val` for current binary value and `power` for current bit index.

## üßÆ Formula

If s[i] == '0' ‚Üí Always count it
If s[i] == '1' ‚Üí Add if val + 2^power <= k

## ‚è± Time & Space Complexity

| Metric           | Complexity |
|------------------|------------|
| Time Complexity  | O(n)       |
| Space Complexity | O(1)       |

## üîç Example

**Input**:  
`s = "1001010", k = 5`  
**Output**: `5`

**Explanation**:  
Possible subsequence: `"00010"` ‚Üí binary value = `2` ‚â§ 5 ‚áí length = 5
