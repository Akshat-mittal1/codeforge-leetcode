## üìÑ Problem Statement

You are given a string `word` and an integer `k`.

A string is called **k-special** if for all characters `i` and `j`:



|freq(i) - freq(j)| <= k

Return the **minimum number of deletions** required to make the string k-special.

---

## üß† Approach (Greedy + Sorted Frequencies)

1. Count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. Sort all the frequencies.
3. For every possible frequency value as the **base minimum**:
   - Delete characters that appear less than this value.
   - Reduce characters that appear more than `base + k` down to `base + k`.
4. Track the **minimum deletions** required across all valid frequency bases.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

| Type              | Value      |
|-------------------|------------|
| Time Complexity   | O(n¬≤)      |
| Space Complexity  | O(n)       |

---

## ‚úÖ Example

```python
Input: word = "aabbcccc", k = 1

Frequencies: a:2, b:2, c:4  
Try base = 2 ‚Üí reduce c:4 ‚Üí 3 deletions  
Try base = 3 ‚Üí delete a,b: total 4 deletions  
‚Üí Minimum deletions = 1

Output: 1
```
