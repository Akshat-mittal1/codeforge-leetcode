# 🔍 Problem: Minimum Number of Groups to Partition Array
# 📍 Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-groups-to-partition-array/
# 📂 Category: Medium
# 📅 Date Solved: 19-June-2025

"""
🧠 Approach:
- Sort the array to bring close numbers together.
- Start a new group whenever the current number differs from the group's minimum by more than `k`.

⏱️ Time Complexity: O(n log n)
📦 Space Complexity: O(1)

class Solution(object):
    def partitionArray(self, nums, k):
        nums.sort()
        count = 1
        min_val = nums[0]

        for num in nums[1:]:
            if num - min_val > k:

# ✅ Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    sol = Solution()
    nums = [3, 6, 1, 2, 5]
    k = 2
    print("Minimum number of groups:", sol.partitionArray(nums, k))  # Output: 2
