## üìÑ Problem Statement

You are given a string `sequence` consisting of digits from **0 to 4**, and an integer `window_size`.  
Your task is to find the **maximum possible value of**:

count(a) - count(b)

Where:
- `a ‚â† b`
- Both digits must appear **at least once** in the window of size `window_size`.

---

## üß† Approach

1. Iterate over all 25 digit pairs `(a, b)` where `a ‚â† b`.
2. For each pair:
   - Use a sliding window of length `window_size`.
   - Use prefix sums and parity optimization to track the frequency difference of the two digits.
   - Map parities using: `((x % 2) << 1) | (y % 2)` to minimize storage.
3. Track maximum difference only when both digits are present in the window.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(25 √ó n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

## ‚úÖ Example

```python
Input:
sequence = "120201201"
window_size = 5

Possible Window: "20120"
‚Üí count(2) = 2, count(0) = 1 ‚Üí diff = 1
‚Üí count(1) = 1, count(2) = 2 ‚Üí diff = 1

Output: 2
```
