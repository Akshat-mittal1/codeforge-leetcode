## üìÑ Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the **longest subsequence** `sub` such that `sub` repeated `k` times is a subsequence of `s`.  
If multiple answers exist, return the **lexicographically largest** one.

---

## üß† Approach

- Count frequency of each character in `s` and keep only those that appear at least `k` times.
- Use **BFS** to generate all possible subsequences using the valid character set.
- For each candidate `sub`:
  - Check whether `sub * k` is a subsequence of `s`.
  - If yes, update the result if it's longer or lexicographically larger than the previous.
- Always try larger lexicographic characters first (to favor larger subsequence).

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** Exponential (branching factor per character)
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for queue and result storage

---

## ‚úÖ Example

```python
Input:
s = "letsleetcode"
k = 2

Check: Is "let" √ó 2 = "letlet" a subsequence of s?

Yes ‚Üí Valid

Output: "let"
```
