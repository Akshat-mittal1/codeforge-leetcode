## üìÑ Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, divide it into groups of size `k`. The last group may be shorter than `k` characters. If so, fill it with the given `fill` character until its length is `k`.

Return a list of string groups.

---

## üß† Approach

- Calculate how many characters are needed to make `s`'s length a multiple of `k`.
- Traverse `s` in steps of `k` and collect substrings.
- For the last group, if it's shorter, fill it with the `fill` character.

---

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)

---

## ‚úÖ Example

```python
Input:
s = "abcdefghi", k = 3, fill = "x"

Steps:
- Groups: "abc", "def", "ghi"
- No padding needed

Output: ["abc", "def", "ghi"]
```
