## üß© Problem Statement

You are given an integer `num`. You must choose a digit and **replace all occurrences** of it in the number with **another digit** (0‚Äì9) such that:

- After one transformation (to get max),
- And another transformation (to get min),

Return the **difference** between max and min you can get.

---

## üöÄ Approach

1. Convert the number to a string.
2. For maximum:
   - Replace the first non-9 digit with 9.
3. For minimum:
   - Replace the first digit with 0.
4. Reconstruct both numbers digit by digit.
5. Return `max - min`.

## ‚è±Ô∏è Time & Space Complexity

- **Time**: O(d), where `d = number of digits in num`
- **Space**: O(1)

---

## üí° Example

```python
Input: num = 11891
Max version: 99899
Min version: 11001
Output: 99899 - 11001 = 88898
